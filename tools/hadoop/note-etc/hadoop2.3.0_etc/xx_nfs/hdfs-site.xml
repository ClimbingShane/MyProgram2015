<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.name.dir</name>
  <value>file:///home/goldmsg/dfsdata/name</value>
  <description>Determines where on the local filesystem the DFS name node
  should store the name table(fsimage).  If this is a comma-delimited list
  of directories then the name table is replicated in all of the
  directories, for redundancy. </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.data.dir</name>
  <value>file:///home/goldmsg/dfsdata/data</value>
  <description>Determines where on the local filesystem an DFS data node
  should store its blocks.  If this is a comma-delimited
  list of directories, then data will be stored in all named
  directories, typically on different devices.
  Directories that do not exist are ignored.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.checkpoint.dir</name>
  <value>file:///home/goldmsg/dfsdata/namesecondary</value>
  <description>Determines where on the local filesystem the DFS secondary
  name node should store the temporary images to merge.
  If this is a comma-delimited list of directories then the image is
  replicated in all of the directories for redundancy.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.replication</name>
  <value>1</value>
  <description>Default block replication. 
  The actual number of replications can be specified when the file is created.
  The default is used if replication is not specified in create time.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.permissions.enabled</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>
  If "true", enable permission checking in HDFS.
  If "false", permission checking is turned off,
  but all other behavior is unchanged.
  Switching from one parameter value to the other does not change the mode,
  owner or group of files or directories.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.accesstime.precision</name>
  <value>3600000</value>
  <description>The access time for HDFS file is precise upto this value. 
               The default value is 1 hour. Setting a value of 0 disables
               access times for HDFS.
  </description>
</property>

<property>    
  <name>nfs.dump.dir</name>
  <value>/tmp/.hdfs-nfs</value>
  <description>
    This directory is used to temporarily save out-of-order writes before
    writing to HDFS. For each file, the out-of-order writes are dumped after
    they are accumulated to exceed certain threshold (e.g., 1MB) in memory. 
    One needs to make sure the directory has enough space.

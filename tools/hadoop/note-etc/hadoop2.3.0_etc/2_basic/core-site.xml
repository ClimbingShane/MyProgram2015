<property>
  <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
  <value>hdfs://centos2:9000</value>
  <description>The name of the default file system.  A URI whose
  scheme and authority determine the FileSystem implementation.  The
  uri's scheme determines the config property (fs.SCHEME.impl) naming
  the FileSystem implementation class.  The uri's authority is used to
  determine the host, port, etc. for a filesystem.

<property>
  <name>hadoop.user.group.static.mapping.overrides</name>
  <value>dr.who=hadoop;KINKOO=hadoop;</value>
  <description>
    Static mapping of user to groups. This will override the groups if
    available in the system for the specified user. In otherwords, groups
    look-up will not happen for these users, instead groups mapped in this
    configuration will be used.
    Mapping should be in this format.
    user1=group1,group2;user2=;user3=group2;
    Default, "dr.who=;" will consider "dr.who" as user without groups.

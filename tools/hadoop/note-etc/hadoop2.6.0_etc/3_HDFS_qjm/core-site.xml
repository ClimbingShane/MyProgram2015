<!-- Put site-specific property overrides in this file. -->

<configuration>

<property>
  <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
  <value>hdfs://gmcluster</value>
  <description>The name of the default file system.  A URI whose
  scheme and authority determine the FileSystem implementation.  The
  uri's scheme determines the config property (fs.SCHEME.impl) naming
  the FileSystem implementation class.  The uri's authority is used to
  determine the host, port, etc. for a filesystem.</description>
</property>

<!-- ssh. -->
<property>
  <name>dfs.ha.fencing.methods</name>
  <value>sshfence</value>
  <description>
    List of fencing methods to use for service fencing. May contain
    builtin methods (eg shell and sshfence) or user-defined method.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.ha.fencing.ssh.connect-timeout</name>
  <value>30000</value>
  <description>
    SSH connection timeout, in milliseconds, to use with the builtin
    sshfence fencer.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>dfs.ha.fencing.ssh.private-key-files</name>
  <value>/home/goldmsg/.ssh/id_rsa</value>
  <description>
    The SSH private key files to use with the builtin sshfence fencer.
  </description>
</property>

<!-- Static Web User Filter properties. -->
<property>
  <description>
    The user name to filter as, on static web filters
    while rendering content. An example use is the HDFS
    web UI (user to be used for browsing files).
  </description>
  <name>hadoop.http.staticuser.user</name>
  <value>goldmsg</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>ha.zookeeper.quorum</name>
  <value>centos141:2181,centos142:2181,centos147:2181</value>
  <description>
    A list of ZooKeeper server addresses, separated by commas, that are
    to be used by the ZKFailoverController in automatic failover.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>ha.zookeeper.session-timeout.ms</name>
  <value>10000</value>
  <description>
    The session timeout to use when the ZKFC connects to ZooKeeper.
    Setting this value to a lower value implies that server crashes
    will be detected more quickly, but risks triggering failover too
    aggressively in the case of a transient error or network blip.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>ha.zookeeper.parent-znode</name>
  <value>/hadoop-cdh5-4-3-ha</value>
  <description>
    The ZooKeeper znode under which the ZK failover controller stores
    its information. Note that the nameservice ID is automatically
    appended to this znode, so it is not normally necessary to
    configure this, even in a federated environment.
